                    <p>We make our money from private ads on our search engine.
					On other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled
					about you using your personal information like search, browsing,
					and purchase history. Since we don’t collect that information, search ads
					on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you are viewing, not on you
					as a person. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-revenue-model/" target="_blank" >Learn more</a>.</p>

                    <p>Not only does Google keep your search history forever by

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in
					part because Google tracks your searches and hides trackers on 
					millions of websites. By contrast, our private search engine doesn’t 
					track your searches and our <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile 
					app </a>block Google’s (and many other companies’) trackers across the
					Internet, helping to keep your browsing history more private, as it
					should be. And that’s just the beginning —by using DuckDuckGo you 
					also escape the manipulation of the filter bubble and can use the Internet 
					faster (after all that tracking code is disabled). <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/why-use-duckduckgo-instead-of-google/" target="_blank" >Learn more</a>.</p>

<h1 class="faq-page"> <img src="images/down arrow.png">Is DuckDuckGo an “unfiltered” search engine?</h1>
                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Unlike some other search engines, we don’t alter
					search results based on someone’s previous search history. 
					In fact, since we don’t track our users we don’t have access
					to search histories at all! Those other search engines 
					show you results based on a data profile about you and your
					online activity (including your search history), and so can be 
					slanted towards what they think you will click on the most based 
					on this profiling. This effect is commonly known as the <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/google-filter-bubble-study/">search filter
					bubble</a>, but using DuckDuckGo can help you escape it.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>This does not mean our search results are generally “unfiltered”
 because, for every search you make online, a search engine’s job is 
 to filter millions of possible results down to a ranked order of
 just a handful. In other words, a search engine has to use algorithms 
 programmed by people to determine what shows up first in the list of 
 results, what shows up second, and so on. Otherwise, for every search you’d
 just get a completely random set of results, which of course wouldn’t be very useful.</p>

                    <p>It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called “Incognito” mode.
					In fact, Incognito mode mainly just deletes information on your computer and does
					nothing to stop Google from saving your searches, nor does it stop companies,
					Internet service providers, or governments from being able to track you across 
					the Internet. By contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous and if you
